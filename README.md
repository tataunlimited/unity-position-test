# Unity Developer Position Assessment

This is the specification for the Unity Developer Position Assessment.
The goal of this document is to faciliate a proper assessment of the applicant's ability to contribute to our Unity Development team.
This document is intended as a suggestion for how to demonstrate your fitness for the project to us.
If you want to demonstrate it in a better way, you're free to do so, but keep in mind that we have included these items for a reason.
